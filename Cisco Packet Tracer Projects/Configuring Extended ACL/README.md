# Configuring Extended ACLs – Packet Tracer Lab

## Overview
This lab shows how to configure extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Cisco Packet Tracer to control specific types of network traffic based on protocol, source, and destination.

## Objectives
- Implement a numbered extended ACL to permit FTP and ICMP traffic.
- Create a named extended ACL to permit HTTP and ICMP.
- Apply ACLs to router interfaces.
- Test and verify correct ACL behaviour.

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Results
ACLs filtered traffic correctly, allowing permitted services and blocking unauthorized access between subnets.

## Evidence
Screenshots of router configuration, ACL entries, interface application, and verification tests are included in the `screenshots/` folder.
