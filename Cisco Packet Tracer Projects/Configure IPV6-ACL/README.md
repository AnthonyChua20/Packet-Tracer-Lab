# IPv6 Access Control Lists – Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of IPv6 Access Control Lists (ACLs)
to control and secure network traffic in a simulated environment.

## Objectives
- Configure IPv6 addressing on network devices
- Apply IPv6 ACLs to restrict unauthorized traffic
- Verify ACL behavior through testing

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IPv6 Networking
- IPv6 ACLs

## Learning Outcome
This project improved my understanding of IPv6 traffic filtering and how access
control mechanisms are used to enhance network security.
